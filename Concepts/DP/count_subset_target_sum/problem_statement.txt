Absolutely! Here's the **problem statement** and a **Python test suite using `unittest`** for the **Count Subsets with a Given Sum** problem.

### ğŸ§© Problem Statement: Count of Subsets with Given Sum

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a target sum `target`, return the **number of distinct subsets** of `nums` that sum up to exactly `target`.

You may assume:

* Each element can be used **at most once** (i.e., no repetition).
* Subsets are counted uniquely based on the indices of elements used.

---

### ğŸ“¥ Input

* `nums` (`List[int]`): A list of **positive integers**.
* `target` (`int`): The target sum to achieve.

---

### ğŸ“¤ Output

* An integer representing the **number of subsets** that sum to `target`.

---

### ğŸ§  Example 1

```python
Input: nums = [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10], target = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: Subsets are [2, 8], [10], [5, 3, 2]
```

---

### ğŸ§  Example 2

```python
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 3], target = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: Subsets are [1, 2, 3], [3, 3], [1, 2, 3] (distinct by index).
```
