    This means: "Item i was not used in the optimal solution for this subproblem."

    Why? Because the optimal profit didnâ€™t change when item i was considered.

    So, we move up the table (i.e., exclude item i) and check the previous item.

    and then
    """

    # else:
    #     # Item i was used at least once
    #     pos.append(...)  # either size or position
    #     j -= i  # reduce capacity by the item's weight (length)

    """

    If the value did change (st[i][j] != st[i-1][j]), it means we included item i in the solution.

    So, you:

    Record the choice (i or j)

    Subtract the weight (length i) from capacity j (since that much is used up)

    Continue with the same item i (because it can be reused in unbounded knapsack)
